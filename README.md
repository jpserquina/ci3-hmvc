# Codeigniter 3 with HMVC - updated

tl;dr - an update to the popular CI3-HMVC project by "wiredesignz", this allows (a) app modules to access their own site assets with finer granularity, and (b) enable common views, controllers or models that are shareable across modules

Developed with Carl Louis Manuel, Jameel Gerona, and Tweetie Sabado.

Heavily WIP at the moment, as we clean up redundant and unnecessary code references. 

Original README.MD below:
